
In a house at the eastern corner of the Palatine, called “At the
Oxheads,”[1] on the 23rd of September, B.C. 63—some nine weeks before
the execution of the Catilinarian conspirators by Cicero’s order—a child
was born destined to close the era of civil wars thus inaugurated, to
organise the Roman Empire, and to be its master for forty-four years.

The father of the child was Gaius Octavius, of the plebeian _gens
Octavia_, and of a family that had long occupied a high position in the
old Volscian town of Velitræ. Two branches of the Octavii were descended
from C. Octavius Rufus, quæstor in B.C. 230. The elder branch had
produced five consuls and other Roman magistrates, but of the younger
branch Gaius Octavius, the father of Augustus, was the first to hold
curule office. According to the inscription, afterwards placed by his
son in the _sacrarium_ of the palace,[2] he had twice served as military
tribune, had been quæstor, plebeian ædile, iudex quæstionum, and prætor.
