Explorations in data science (Level 2 Project for Alex)
=======================================================


Please visit  https://www.gutenberg.org/ and download a book (in text format) that you like.

And you will write a python program to answer these 10 questions.

Your python program should display these 10 choices to the user.
One the user selects a choice, your program produces the answer.


You will be exploring many topics (basic python, conditions, methods, lists, sets, dictionaries, file reading) while doing this project.
Please ensure that your program is well documented, and is thoroughly tested.

[1] What are the top 10 most frequent words in the book?
You should only list top 10 words.
And these words should be alphabetically sorted.

[2] How manys sentences are there in the book?

[3] Provide a table of "sentence number" and the "count of words" in that sentence?

[4] How many words there in Nth sentence?

[5] What is the total number of words in the book?

[6] How many unique words are there in the book?  

[7] What is the average number of words per sentence in the book?

[8] Can you produce another book with each word of the book reversed?
Save that book as "reversed.book"

[9] Are there any palindromes in the book?
Ignore the punctuation marks and symbols while figuring out whether a word is a palindrome are not.

[10] Given a word, list all the sentences in which the word is appearing?
